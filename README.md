Description: 
A web-based application which will serve as a virtual study room for students at USC. 
The interface will allow students to network with each other for studying and will include 
chat channels/rooms organized by specific class IDs and course subjects at USC. Students will 
be able to upload notes and other materials for collaboration studying and search for users in 
the same or similar classes. The use of chat channels for each class will encourage open 
discussion between students by providing a more transient and casual environment for discussion 
than Piazza or e-mail. Additionally, we will use location-based services and dynamic notifications 
to facilitate real-world collaboration between students.


Known bugs (Work-in-progress):
- Friending is not fully functional
- Post/Document sorting is not fully functional (This will be delineated in our tech specs)
- Documents can only be uploaded/downloaded on the non-local instance of the project
- Course chat broadcasts to all courses, not just the course page you are on
- Some page styles may not load properly/layout issues
- Homepage moderated course list does not update
- Log out navigation button does not work for all pages
- Active user session sometimes closes randomly and causes page exceptions
